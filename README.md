Rokfor Content Management used as Base Engine for all Rokfor Projects

Think of Rokfor Content Management as something like Filemaker but based on MySQL and PHP. We're focusing on a book-like data structure, whereas the content is stored in books, issues, chapters and contributions. Latter is something like a form which can be dynamically configured within the Rokfor administrative backend.

These forms - or templates as we call them - can be assigned to different users. Users have roles: normal users, administrators and superusers.

Rokfor has its roots in print-publishing, where the writer of text passes the final control to the editor.

* Documentation, a lot! In the doc folder there's some autogenerated doxygen stuff, but it should be generated newly.
* Rokfor has a database abstraction class which should be remodeled soon.
* Rokfor has a json api which should be also cleaned up and documented soon.
